# TomatoClassifier
I have tried all the  common architecture like VGG, Resnet-50,Alexnet,Inception v3.But the I got the best result form InceptionV3,so I have uploaded that file.

1-Data Collection and Understanding:

The given dataset was collected from the following link-https://www.kaggle.com/noulam/tomato

There are 10 different types of diseased leaf.And there are 18k images in the training and around 4k in images the test set.

2-Model used and Performance

Here I have tried transfer learning on the Inception v3 and I got a accuracy of 85% on both the training and test dataset within 5 epochs
